## Getting Started

TerminusDB Query Cookbook is a collection of guides showing how to query using GraphQL, WOQL and in other ways. TerminusDB is a graph database and document store that is great for data integration, knowledge management, knowledge engineering, content management, and data analytics.

* [Getting Started with WOQL](/docs/woql-getting-started)

In this guide, we introduce the basic concepts of WOQL and show how to use it to query a TerminusDB database.

## Datatypes

WOQL is powerful enough to support a wide range of datatypes. In this guide, we show how to use WOQL to query TerminusDB using different datatypes.

* [Cookbook: Datatypes](/docs/cookbook-woql-type-of-datatype)

This guide covers how to match datatypes, understand the datatype of a value and check that a value is of a datatype.

## Git-for-data, query across graphs

TerminusDB includes a Git-for-data feature that also allows you to query across knowledge graphs.

* [Cookbook: Many Graphs](/docs/datalog-queries-between-data-products/)

This guide shows how to use WOQL to query a TerminusDB data product that has many graphs, or between completely separate data products.

## Pattern Generation

In this guide, we show how to use WOQL to query a TerminusDB database with pattern generation.

* [Cookbook: Pattern Generation](/docs/pattern-generation-cookbook/)
