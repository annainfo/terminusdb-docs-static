Assuming you have [connected with the Python Client](/docs/connect-with-python-client/), created a database, and made a few commits, you can reset the HEAD of a database to a particular commit. Just like you would do in `git` with `git reset`.

## Get the commits list

You can use the Python Client Library method to get a list of branch commits. This example uses pagination to get the last commits starting from the branch head -

```python
//For TerminusCMS
from terminusdb_client import Client
client = Client('https://cloud.terminusdb.com/MyTeam')
client.connect(team='MyTeam' db='your_db', api_token='YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE')
commits = client.logs(count=10)
print(commits)
// For TerminusDB
from terminusdb_client import Client
client = Client('http://localhost:6363')
client.connect(key='root', user='root', team='root' db='your_db')
commits = client.logs(count=10)
print(commits)
```

A response example will be a list of objects like this:

```json
{
  "@id":"InitialCommit/hpl18q42dbnab4vzq8me4bg1xn8p2a0",
  "@type":"InitialCommit",
  "author":"system",
  "identifier":"hpl18q42dbnab4vzq8me4bg1xn8p2a0",
  "message":"create initial schema",
  "schema":"layer_data:Layer_4234adfe377fa9563a17ad764ac37f5dcb14de13668ea725ef0748248229a91b",
  "timestamp":1660919664.9129035
}
```

## Reset to a specific commit

To reset the HEAD of your database to a particular commit, you need to get the identifier of a particular commit. To obtain the identifier, refer to the code snippet above.

```python
client.reset("hpl18q42dbnab4vzq8me4bg1xn8p2a0")
```
