# Clone a Project

From the project home page, on the right you will see the `Clone Project` section.

You can clone the project with -

*   The same name to another team - choose this from the dropdown menu
*   A different name to another team
*   A different name to the same team

Press the `Clone` button.

You will be directed to the cloned project. If you clone to a different team, you will also move teams.
