The DFRNT TerminusDB cloud features query panes for [GraphQL](/docs/graphql-basics/) and [WOQL](/docs/woql-basics/).

## GraphQL Query Pane

![GraphQL playground](https://assets.terminusdb.com/docs/graphql-playground.png)

The DFRNT TerminusDB cloud includes GraphiQL to experiment and test queries. It automatically generates the GraphQL schema based on the project's schema.

It includes -

*   List of root types within the project
*   Autofill to aid query construction
*   Pretty print
*   Results panel
*   Error reporting

For more details about the types of queries available with GraphQL, such as path queries, filters, and arguments, please refer to the [GraphQL reference guide](/docs/graphql-query-reference/).

### WOQL Query Pane

The DFRNT TerminusDB cloud features query panes for both [GraphQL](/docs/graphql-basics/) and [WOQL](/docs/woql-basics/).

Web Object Query Language ([WOQL](/docs/woql-explanation/)) is a powerful and sophisticated query language which allows you to concisely express complex patterns over arbitrary data structures.

The playground enables users to build WOQL queries to experiment and test. Users can also -

*   Add, edit, and delete documents
*   View query as JSON-LD format
*   Copy the query
*   See results
*   Select query parameters based on the schema (left side of the screen)

Please see these other resources for understanding and using WOQL -

*   [WOQL Basics](/docs/woql-basics/)
*   [WOQL reference guide](/docs/woql-class-reference-guide/)
