Cloud hosted TemrinusDB is available from [https://dfrnt.com](https://dfrnt.com/hypergraph-content-studio/). Register an account or sign up if you haven't already to get started fast.

Click on the **team** that you wish to use or create a new one. A default one will be already created for you. After selecting your team, click on your profile icon in the upper-right corner and click on `Profile`.

In this screen, you can create an API Token and view instructions for different clients. Give the token a description and click "Generate New Token". The token will appear on the screen. Be sure to save it somewhere safe, as the token gives access to your databases. For security reasons, we only display it once on this screen.

Choose one of the code snippets. Which is either Python, JavaScript, or a cURL example.
