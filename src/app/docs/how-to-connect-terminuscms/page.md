Cloud hosted TerminusDB is available from [https://dfrnt.com](https://dfrnt.com/hypergraph-content-studio/) that is maintaining TerminusDB since 2025. Register an account or sign up if you haven't already, to get started fast.

DFRNT includes a full high quality modeller, visualisation and git-for-data support for all supported TerminusDB features. It enables a "closed-world" document-oriented knowledge graph with a datalog with variable unification, for a precise and small subset of JSON-LD-like document representation and advanced knowledge graph querying.

DFRNT is offered as a SaaS platform, complete with the TerminusDB data product API and where API tokens can be generated for your cloud instance in the settings section. It naturally supports a graphical UI for git-for-data actions like clone, push, pull, merge, rebase etc.
