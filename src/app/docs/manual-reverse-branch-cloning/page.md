## Reverse Branch Cloning

Reverse branch clonings is useful when the basic clone command can't be used, such as when the source TerminusDB instance is in a location that a cloud instance can't connect to. Another reason could be that just a branch should be moved between two data products and not the entire data product.

In most circumstances, the `clone` command can be used to move a data product branch from a cloud TerminusDB instance to a localhost instance, or from a cloud instance to another cloud instance or team.

How to reverse clone a data product branch from a localhost instance to a cloud instance, is described here. The baseic procedure goes like this:

1. If the cloud data product does not exist, create a new empty one
1. Setup a remote in the localhost data product from the cloud instance
1. Fetch the remote data product from the cloud instance
1. Push the relevant branch, such as `main` from localhost to the remote data product `main` branch
1. Move any additional branches that should be moved
1. Copy title, description and other attributes of the data product to the cloud version. 

Read more about [git-for-data](/docs/git-for-data-reference/) for more information on how to use TerminusDB and git-for-data.
