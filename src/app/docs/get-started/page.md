## Getting started with TerminusDB in less than a minute

TerminusDB is a versatile content storage system for model-based hierarchically structured records. It is straightforward to use as a flexible headless content management system.

It is designed to give technical professionals and linked data professionals a solution for complex content, knowledge and semantic infrastructures. Bringing together change request workflows, analytics, and complex integrations, TerminusDB aims to be a content platform that sits at the convergence of content and knowledge.

TerminusDB is open source and free to use, maintained by the team at DFRNT in collaboration with the community.

Commercial hosting with a powerful modeller, visualisation, WOQL studio, and record editor user interface is available at [DFRNT.com](https://dfrnt.com/hypergraph-content-studio/) with a free trial. It works with both localhost open source TerminusDB and TerminusDB hosted in the cloud environments, including git-for-data synchronization of content repositories. 

When you sign up, you get full commercial hosting. This comes with generous limits to allow you to build without constraints, and then upgrade when needed.

### Steps to get started

1.  Sign up at [https://dfrnt.com/signup](https://dfrnt.com/signup), or use it with [Docker](/docs/install-terminusdb-as-a-docker-container/)
3.  Install the [JavaScript](/docs/install-terminusdb-js-client/) or [Python](/docs/install-the-python-client/) Client
4.  [Get your API key to use a client with the DFRNT TerminusDB cloud](/docs/how-to-connect-terminuscms/)
5.  [Familiarize yourself with the client API](/docs/connect-with-the-javascript-client/) to start building with TerminusDB.
