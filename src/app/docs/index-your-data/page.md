Once you have configured OpenAI, you can index your data. Indexing happens on a commit level so to start indexing you need a new commit.

To do this, create and approve a change request. The indexing process will begin.

You can see the commit index history by clicking on the cog symbol on the left. Here you can also restart indexing processes.

Once you have indexed your data, you can ask the semantic index server questions about your data and content.

To sumbit prompts about your data, select the magnifying glass icon from the left and fill in the form with your prompts.
