TerminusDB provides a special-purpose closed world assumption RDF knowledge graph implementation with high performance in-memory performance leveraging succinct auto-indexing datastructures.

It offers controlled document API interfaces with a terse JSON-LD-like syntax, GraphQL for precise data query needs and a datalog logical engine with variables bindings for complex queries across the graph.

It includes features that are important when building semantic content infrastructures for complex environments: with immutable history and git-for-data/git-for-graphs branching, merging and synchronization. In effect, it provides a foundation for building a graph data mesh with RDF closed world data products.

The [product tour](/docs/product-tour/) aims to provide you with an understanding of how to navigate the product and get started on your projects.

## Quick start

The easiest way to get started with TerminusDB knowledge graphs is with a cloud instance from the official TerminusDB hosting provider, [DFRNT.com](https://dfrnt.com/hypergraph-content-studio/). It provides a complete enhanced entity relations knowledge graph data modeller, git-for-data synchronization, graph visualisations, GraphQL, APIs and a complete datalog studio with and an easy-to-use model-driven form-based record editor.

TerminusDB is open source and free to use under the Apache 2.0 license. Get started with the open source community version on your own computer, by [getting started with Docker](/docs/install-terminusdb-as-a-docker-container/).

The cloud modeller, visualisations and records management tool works with both localhost open source TerminusDB (connecting to your localhost:6363 port) and TerminusDB hosted in the cloud environments. Your can use git-for-data synchronizations of content repositories between cloud and localhost as a backup and for collaboration with peers.
