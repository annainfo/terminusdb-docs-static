TerminusDB includes many features to build content infrastructures for complex environments with content repositories at it's heart, also known as data products. The [product tour](/docs/product-tour/) aims to provide you with an understanding of how to navigate the product and get started on your projects.

[DFRNT](https://dfrnt.com/hypergraph-content-studio/) took the lead of the continued development of TerminusDB in 2025 as main sponsors of the project, and community efforts. We offer cloud and managed service TerminusDB hosting, and an advanced data product modeller that can also be used with locally installed open source TerminusDB instances. We have been building our dedicated modeller since 2021.

Our customers use TerminusDB for various complex information processing needs: such as Product Information Management, Reference Data Management, Cultural Heritage, special purpose Customer Relationship Management, Non-Profit Records Management, Linked Data, and more. 

We maintain close communications with the original TerminusDB development team who support our efforts, and of course welcome contributions from the community!

## Quick start

The easiest way to get started with the open source community version on your own computer is by [getting started with Docker](/docs/install-terminusdb-as-a-docker-container/).

TerminusDB is open source and free to use. Commercial hosting with a powerful modeller, visualisation, WOQL studio, and record editor user interface is available at [DFRNT](https://dfrnt.com/hypergraph-content-studio/) with a free trial. 

The commercial modeller, visualisations and records management tool works with both localhost open source TerminusDB and TerminusDB hosted in the cloud environments, including git-for-data synchronization of content repositories between cloud and localhost.
