[DFRNT](https://dfrnt.com/hypergraph-content-studio/) took the lead of the continued development of TerminusDB in 2025 as main sponsors of the project, and community efforts. We offer cloud and managed service TerminusDB hosting, and an advanced data product modeller that can also be used with locally installed open source TerminusDB instances. We have been building our dedicated modeller since 2021.

Our customers use TerminusDB for various complex information processing needs: such as Product Information Management, Reference Data Management, Cultural Heritage, special purpose Customer Relationship Management, Non-Profit Records Management, Linked Data, and more. 

We maintain close communications with the original TerminusDB development team who support our efforts, and of course welcome contributions from the community!

## Quick start

The easiest way to get started with TerminusDB knowledge graphs is by using the official hosting privider [DFRNT.com](https://dfrnt.com/hypergraph-content-studio/). It provides a complete enhanced entity relations knowldge graph data modeller, git-for-data synchronization, graph visualisations, the WOQL logical studio, and an easy-to-use model-driven form-based record editor.

TerminusDB is open source and free to use under the Apache 2.0 license. Get started with the open source community version on your own computer, by [getting started with Docker](/docs/install-terminusdb-as-a-docker-container/).

The cloud modeller, visualisations and records management tool works with both localhost open source TerminusDB (connecting to your localhost:6363 port) and TerminusDB hosted in the cloud environments. Your can use git-for-data synchronizations of content repositories between cloud and localhost as a backup and for collaboration with peers.
