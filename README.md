# terminusdb-docs-static

The static TerminusCMS and TerminusDB documentation that can be found on
https://terminusdb.org/docs . It is written in NextJS and can be build
by running `npm run build`. Note that the API key is needed for access
to the data product.

## Schema and documentation snapshot

A documentation snapshot can be generated by running the crawler:

```sh
./run-crawler.sh --assets-domain assets.terminusdb.com --max-pages 200 --download-media
```

This will generate a `all_documents.json` file in the `output` directory.

## Schema

The schema for the documentation snapshot is located in the `schema` directory, together with an example of the output and a copy of the menu-structure based on the CMS schema published in the Terminusdb blogposts and based on the generated json files on terminusdb.com/docs in the NEXT hydration section with minor edits.

## Menu structure

The menu structure is located in the `menu-structure.json` file in the `schema` directory and can be loaded directly into TerminusDB using the schema.

## Media

Media files can be downloaded using the command above.
